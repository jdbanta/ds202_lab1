# Name

My name is John Banta

# My Major

What I tell most people about my major is it's all getting me ready to be an actuary (a risk assessor).

# Organizational Strategies

I have a lot of organizational strategies but three are:

## Colored folders

I use different colored folders and match the color to the notebooks to 
know which one is for each of my classes.

## Every class gets its own file

All of my classes has their own folder on my desktop to keep one class's work separate from all of my other classes.

## PowerPlanner

PowerPlanner is a useful app that I use to keep track of the homework throughout the semester. I even color the classes in the app to match the folders that I have for the corresponding classes.
